put these files in the TFR Music Addon folder (program archives > steam > steamapps > workshop > content > 394360 > 3350892196)
"radiolatam" folder goes in "music" folder
"radio_latam_album_art.dds" and "TFR_album_covers" folder must go in the gfx folder
"album_covers.gfx", "music_station_radio_latam.gfx" and "music_station_radio_latam.gui" must go in the "interface" folder
"tfr_music_l_english.yml" goes in the localization folder

if the music addon gets updated in the workshop, "album_covers.gfx" and "tfr_music_l_english.yml" will be overwritten.
you'll have to manually add the parts of those files that correspond to Radio Viveza/LATAM back into the new version of said files. overwritting them entirely is not recomended because it might cause some lacking code for the new content from the workshop

i swear if i find a better way to have this addon stored i will do it just wait y'all
