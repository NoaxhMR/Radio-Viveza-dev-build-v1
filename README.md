put these files in the TFR Music Addon folder (program archives > steam > steamapps > workshop > content > 394360 > 3350892196) ------ 
"radiolatam" folder goes in "music" folder -------- 
"radio_latam_album_art.dds" folder must go in the gfx folder ------- 
move the content of "TFR_album_covers" to the folder of the same name in the base addon (DONT MOVE THE FOLDER WITH IT, ONLY WHAT'S IN IT. OTHERWISE YOU'LL OVERWRITE IT AND YOU'LL LOSE THE ALBUM COVERS FOR THE OTHER SONGS) ----- 
"album_covers.gfx", "music_station_radio_latam.gfx" and "music_station_radio_latam.gui" must go in the "interface" folder ------- 
"tfr_music_l_english.yml" goes in the localization folder ------ 

if the music addon gets updated in the workshop, "album_covers.gfx" and "tfr_music_l_english.yml" will be overwritten. ----- 
you'll have to manually add the parts of those files that correspond to Radio Viveza/LATAM back into the new version of said files. overwritting them entirely is not recomended because it might cause some lacking code for the new content from the workshop ----- 

i swear if i find a better way to have this addon stored i will do it just wait y'all
